1. Check the must-have files by  ls /etc/openvpn or ls /etc/openvpn/server/
 - ca.crt
 - crl.pem
 - dh.pem
 - server.conf  
 - server.crt  
 - server.key
 optional files:
 - client_connect to take action before a vpn connection
 - client_disconnect to take action after a vpn disconnection
 - learn-address to modify the firewall dynamically
 
 2. Replace ca.crt, crl.pem, server.crt and server.key with the 3rd party certs and key.
 
 Tips:
 try to disable tls-auth. with tls-auth, it needs another ta.key, which is a static key
