<p>DaddyEye is a peer to peer screenshot capture command line software. NO Server Storage. DIFFERENT ID for every new connection. </p>
<p>It is designed to capture and transfer a screenshot from one MacOS laptop to another one in a secure way. </p>
<p> <b>For command line version, you need to compile it by youself from the c++ source code in the github. </b></p>
<p> For the UI version, you can download the installer. </p>
<p> <b> All texts below are for the command line version.</b></p>
<p>It has two modes: dad and sweet.</p>
<h2> Run on dad mode </h2> 
<p> It will print a dad id as soon as it starts.</p>
<h2> Run on sweet mode </h2> 
<p> ./picap -o sweet </p>
<p> ./picap -o sweet -i dad_id </p>
<p> They will print a sweet id as soon as they start.</p>
<p> The first command line will allow any dad to capture the screen if he knows the sweet's id. </p>
<p> The 2nd command line will only allow one dad with the exact id to to capture the sweet's screen. So, the dad end needs to run first. </p>
  
<h2> Usage for dad mode </h2>
<p>
  1. After the "./picap" runs, then it will print "Enter sweet id:". Check the sweet mode screen.
  If the sweet screen shows "Sweet Mode. https://eliassun.github.io/daddyeye.html for more information.",
  then it means it is ready to capture the screenshot for dad. <b>Important: Make sure the sweet is ready 
  before inputting the sweet id on the dad's screen.</b> Now, find something like </p>
<p> *********** sweet ID *********** </p>
<p> 76mzSKTY </p>
<p> Please copy sweet ID to dad!!! </p>
<p> ********************************* </p>
<p>Input the sweet id(e.g. 76mzSKTY) to the dad screen, then press "Enter" key.</p>
<p>
  2. After the step 1, then it prints:
</p>  
<p> ************************************************************* </p>
<p> In Dad mode, waiting for a command from keyboard. </p>
<p> getscreen: get a sweet screenshot back. </p>
<p> open: open the screenshot after getscreen is done. </p>
<p> Enter a command on screen's anywhere from the key board. </p>
<p> ************************************************************** </p>
<p> Input getscreen on the dad screen, then press "Enter" key, then it will "Decoded a screen", which means it has a screenshot captured. </p>
<p> Input open on the dad screen, then press "Enter" key. This will open the screenshot captured.</p>
</body>
<h2> Usage for sweet mode </h2>
<p> ./picap -o sweet </p>
<p> It will print a sweet id as soon as it starts. This will capture the screenshot if any dad knows this id. </p>
<p> ./picap -o sweet -i dad_id </p>
<p> This will capture the screenshot when only dad with the dad_id. </p>
<p> e.g. the dad's screen shows </p>
<p>*********** dad ID ***********</p>
<p>ciDoZ2cT</p>
<p>On the sweet's screen, run ./piap -o sweet -i dad_id_above .</p>
<p>Then it will only accept the command from this dad. Or it will accept a command from any dad.</p>
<p>*********************************</p>
<p>./picap -o sweet -i ciDoZ2cT</p>
<p>Only dad with ID ciDoZ2cT can capture the screen from the sweet. 
  So, dad must run ./picap first before running ./picap -o sweet -i ciDoZ2cT on the sweet's laptop</p>
